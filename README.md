Jupyter Notebook for the "Big Data and Biology Workshop" session at Pearl Hacks 2019.

To run this notebook, go to Google Colaboratory, select the "Github" tab, and search for the csheare/pearlhacks2019 repository. You should see the notebook appear. Once you open a notebook you can save a copy of it to Google Drive. You may also need to go to “Edit” > “Notebook settings” to change the runtime to Python 3 and to use a GPU if you need it. Otherwise, it just works!
